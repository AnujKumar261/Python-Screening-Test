1. Look carefully at my code and explain where things might be going wrong.

2. Don’t give me the full fixed code or the final solution — just hints, guiding questions, and debugging strategies.

3. Point out specific areas I should check (like loops, conditions, function calls, variable values).

4. Suggest practical debugging moves such as adding print statements, using repr(), checking types with type() or isinstance(), or running small test cases.

5. Remind me of common Python mistakes I might be hitting (like off-by-one errors, mutating a list while iterating, integer vs float division, etc.).

6. If I directly ask you for the solution, please decline politely and instead give me steps to figure it out myself.

7. Keep your tone encouraging, clear, and student-friendly. Ask me questions that make me think, and celebrate small progress.

What I understand

You’ve written a function to return the maximum element of a list of numbers, but for the input [-5, -2, -8] it returns the wrong result (it returns 0 instead of the largest list element).

Where to look first

The initial value of max_num before the loop.

The comparison inside the loop (if num > max_num) and what values get compared.

How the function behaves on edge cases (empty list, single-element list, mixed types).

Tiered hints (gentle → specific)

Level 1 — Conceptual nudges

What should the “current maximum” represent before you see any items from the input list?

If your list contains only negative numbers, is 0 a safe starting candidate for the maximum?

What should the function do when numbers is empty?

Level 2 — Focused checks you can run

Add a print(max_num) right before the loop and a print(num) inside the loop to observe the values being compared.

Run the function on a single-element list (e.g., [7]) — does it return that element?

Try print(find_max([0, -1, -2])) — what do you expect and what do you get?

Level 3 — Debugging moves

Consider initializing the “current max” using an element from the input rather than an unrelated constant. Why might that be more robust?

Add a guard for empty input: decide whether to return None, raise an error, or handle it another way — then add a check and an explicit message/assertion.

Use assertions to document assumptions, e.g., assert that numbers is not empty (for now) while you debug: assert len(numbers) > 0, "expected non-empty input".

Is your function meant to accept non-list iterables (generators)? If so, think about how initialization from the first element would differ.

Level 4 — High-level pattern sketch (no exact code)

Step 1: If the sequence is empty → handle it (error/None).

Step 2: Choose the first element of the sequence as the initial candidate for “current max.”

Step 3: Iterate over the remaining elements and update the candidate when you find a larger item.

Step 4: Return the candidate.

Micro-tests to try

Run these small tests and compare expected vs actual:

[-5, -2, -8] → expected: -2 (largest among negatives)

[3, 1, 2] → expected: 3

[0] → expected: 0

[0, -1, -2] → expected: 0

[] → decide behavior (error or None) and test accordingly

[1.5, 2.0, 1.499] → expected: 2.0

[2, 2, 2] → expected: 2 (duplicate-handling)

Likely Python gotchas to review (relevant here)

Initializing accumulators to a fixed constant (like 0) can fail if inputs can be all negative.

Handling empty inputs (no sensible “first” value).

Mixed-type comparisons (e.g., numbers and None or strings) — ensure inputs are homogeneous.

If you later change to accept iterables, remember some iterables don’t support indexing.

If you’re still stuck, tell me

The exact output you get vs. what you expect for a failing test.

The print traces you saw (the values printed for max_num and num).

Whether you want the function to raise on empty lists or return a neutral value like None.
